While the gross profit increased by 25%, reflecting higher operational efficiency, the net income saw a more modest increase of 12%. This indicates that while revenue growth was strong, there are ongoing challenges in controlling vendor costs and maintaining healthy cash flows, which are essential for long-term profitability.",

Regular permission audits and least-privilege principles are enforced.\n\n2. **Data Protection**:\n   - **Encryption**: Uses TLS 1.3 for data in transit and AES-256 encryption with AWS KMS for data at rest. Field-level encryption is applied to PII and financial data, and database column-level encryption for sensitive fields.\n   - **Data Classification**: Data is categorized by levels: Public, Internal, Confidential (PII, account data), and Restricted (payment credentials, authentication tokens).\n\n3. **Network Security**:\n   - **Perimeter Protection**: Utilizes AWS WAF for web application protection, Cloudflare for DDoS mitigation, and IP whitelisting for administrative endpoints.\n   - **Network Segmentation**: Employs VPCs with public, private, and restricted subnets, complemented by security groups with least-privilege rules and network ACLs as a secondary defense layer.\n   - **API Security**: Implements rate limiting, input validation, sanitization, and request signing for partner APIs.\n\nThese components collectively contribute to a comprehensive security architecture, safeguarding the system against various threats and ensuring compliance with industry standards and regulations.",
